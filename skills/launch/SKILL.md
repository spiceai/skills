name: launch
description: Launch a Spice.ai project on Spice.ai Cloud end to end from a plain-language scenario. It signs the user in to Spice.ai Cloud with a device code (sign-up included), designs the spicepod for the user's sources and models, deploys it, and proves the deployment serves rows, model answers, and MCP tool calls. It then adds monitors and alerts, runs an alert fire drill, and hands off a runbook and agent connection snippets. Use it for demos, POCs, and greenfield production projects — "serve our Snowflake, Postgres, and S3 data to agents with OpenAI", "federate our MySQL and Postgres in one SQL endpoint", "spin up a Spice demo on Cloud for tomorrow", "deploy this spicepod to Spice Cloud with alerting", "make our Spice POC production-ready", "sign me up for Spice Cloud" — and whenever a new Spice deployment must work and be operable, not just configured. Bundles scripts/spice-launch.sh. For a local-only first run use setup; for one-off Cloud API calls use cloud.

# Launch a Spice Project on Spice.ai Cloud

Turn a scenario — "agents need our Snowflake, Postgres, and S3 data, with OpenAI models" — into a
Spice.ai Cloud project that is designed, deployed, tested, monitored, and documented. The result
is something a team can demo, evaluate, or run in production, not a config file that merely
validates.

Spice.ai Cloud is the target: Spice runs the runtime, so the user needs only a Spice.ai account and
sources reachable from the internet. `login` signs them in, or up, with a device code; nobody pastes
a password or token into the conversation.

You do the design work (turning the scenario into a spicepod). The bundled helper,
`scripts/spice-launch.sh` in this skill's directory, does everything mechanical and checks its
own results. Call it by its full path. Progress goes to stderr; each command prints one JSON result
and exits 1 with `error`, `hints`, and `next` when something is wrong.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `login DIR [--wait] [--force]` | Signs in to Spice Cloud: returns at once when this machine has a working credential, else starts a device login and returns a `url` and `code` for the user to approve (sign-up included). `--wait` confirms the credential and lists the user's orgs |
| `preflight DIR [--project ORG/NAME]` | CLI and runtime versions, the Cloud credential and its role in the org (or the orgs it can use), plan limits, regions, spicepod validity, and where each secret reference can come from (local value, org secret, project secret) |
| `local DIR` | Optional: runs the spicepod on a local runtime, queries every dataset and view, then stops that PID. Components whose secrets exist only in Cloud are reported (`needs_cloud_secret`), not failed |
| `create DIR --project ORG/NAME [--region R] [--base ORG/BASE] [--profile P] [--replicas N]` | Creates a managed project (`--kind set`), or forks a base project to inherit its project secrets, on the `stable` channel. Reuses an existing project |
| `secrets DIR [--set NAME]` | Makes each `${ secrets:NAME }` the spicepod uses available to the project: links the org secret of that name, or stores the value from the environment, `.env.local`, or `.env` as a project secret. Fails on a secret it finds nowhere |
| `deploy DIR [--timeout S] [--init-timeout S]` | Uploads the spicepod, deploys (resuming a paused project), and watches the new instance. It stops early on an unresolved secret, a dataset stuck in Error, a federated dataset stuck Initializing, or a model that fails to load, then confirms the endpoint serves the new spicepod |
| `verify DIR [--sql Q]... [--ask Q --expect A] [--search T] [--nsql Q]` | Checks readiness, rows from every dataset and view, model answers (including a tool-grounded answer), embeddings, and an MCP session of several `sql` calls. Measures p50/p99 latency |
| `monitors DIR --profile P [--email E]... [--slack C] [--webhook URL] [--enable-disabled]` | Creates or updates the profile's alerts in place and reads them back. Preserves disabled state unless explicitly approved; reports incomplete coverage |
| `fire-drill DIR [--webhook-token-env VAR \| --webhook-no-token]` | Tests metric evaluation using failed queries, or a temporary memory condition when that template is unavailable. Records recovery, then deletes the monitor. Sends real notifications; recipients must confirm delivery |
| `handoff DIR` | Writes `RUNBOOK.md` and `AGENT-CONNECT.md` from the live project; a re-run replaces only the text between its markers |
| `status DIR` | One-shot health: deployment, instances, unhealthy datasets, alerts and when they last fired, recent problems |
| `pause DIR` | Tears the runtime down and keeps the project, secrets, keys, and monitors; the next `deploy` resumes it |
| `teardown DIR --yes` | Deletes the `launch:` monitors, and the project only if this helper created it |

State, without secrets, lives in `DIR/.spice-launch/state.json`. `create` (and `login` when it saves
to `.env`) adds `.env`, `.env.local`, `.spice-launch/`, and `.spice/` to `DIR/.gitignore`.

## Version Compatibility

Written for **Spice v2.3.x** (checked against v2.3.2) and the Spice.ai Cloud Management API as
tested in October 2026. What to check:

- **The local CLI**: `spice version` (also `spice version -o json`). The helper needs `spice cloud`
  subcommands from CLI v2.3.x (`project create --kind`, `deploy`, `status`, `logs`, `datasets
  --instance`). Older CLIs lack some of them, so read `spice cloud --help` before working around a
  missing command. Installation and upgrades are user-managed: link
  [the installation docs](https://spiceai.org/docs/installation), never run an installer.
- **The project's runtime**: Cloud resolves it from the project's channel (`stable` by default here).
  `deploy` reports the `image_tag` it ran, e.g. `2.3.2-enterprise-models`, and `spiced --version` is
  irrelevant to Cloud. Stable can trail the newest OSS release, so check the
  [changelog](https://docs.spice.ai/changelog) before relying on a feature newer than v2.3.2. Not the
  runtime version: `version: v2` in `spicepod.yaml` or SQL `version()`.
- **Markers**: unmarked content applies to v2.0.0 and later; later additions are marked `(vX.Y.Z+)`.
  On an older runtime, use that line's docs (`https://spiceai.org/docs/v2.2/...`; v2.3 is the
  current, unversioned `https://spiceai.org/docs/...`), never `/docs/next/`.

| Old | Change | Use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spice cloud project create NAME --region R` | Without `--kind` it creates a Cloud Connect project, which Spice does not run (and `--region` is rejected) | `--kind set --region R` (the helper does this) |
| Management API `/v1/apps` routes, `cname` | Deprecated in Aug 2026 (still served) | `/v1/projects`, `region` |
| MCP over SSE (`/v1/mcp/sse`) | Changed in v2.0.0 | Streamable HTTP at `/v1/mcp` |
| `query_latency_p95` monitor | Closed to new monitors | `query_latency_p99` |
| `memory_working_set` threshold in bytes | Now percent of the instance memory limit (values above 1000 still mean bytes) | A percentage such as `85` |
| `openai_tools` model param | Deprecated; attaches no tools | `tools` |
| `image_tag` on a non-Enterprise plan | Rejected (`403 image_tag_requires_enterprise`) | The project's channel |
| `google_api_key` | Breaking in v2.3.0 | Vertex AI params (`google_project`, `google_location`, a credential) |

## What "launched" means

`spice validate` passing, a project existing, or a deployment reading `succeeded` is not done. A
deployment whose new instance never becomes ready sits `in_progress` indefinitely while the
**previous version keeps serving**, so `/v1/ready` can say `ready` with the old datasets. Report
success only when all of these hold:

1. A managed project exists in the intended org and region on the intended channel.
2. The latest deployment succeeded, the runtime's startup check reports every secret reference
   resolved, and the endpoint serves every dataset and model of *this* spicepod as `Ready`.
   `deploy` checks all three (views are not listed by the runtime; `verify` queries them).
3. Every dataset and view returns rows over `/v1/sql`; each model answers, and a model with tools
   answers a data question with the right number; agents can call the MCP `sql` tool. `verify`
   checks these.
4. A latency baseline (p50/p99 over uncached queries) is recorded.
5. Monitors for the profile are enabled and read back with the user's notification targets. Signal
   coverage is checked separately; disabled or unavailable monitors are explicit gaps. With the
   user's consent, a fire drill fires and recipients confirm arrival at each destination.
6. `RUNBOOK.md` and `AGENT-CONNECT.md` exist, and the user has the final report (below).

## Workflow

### 1. Sign in to Spice.ai Cloud

Start here, so the user can approve the sign-in while you design:

```bash
spice-launch.sh login ./acme-agent-data
```

- `logged_in`: this machine already has a working credential; `orgs` lists where it can deploy.
- `waiting_for_approval`: there is none. Tell the user that Spice.ai Cloud needs an account and give
  them the `url` and `code`. On that page, **Continue with GitHub** signs in, or creates the account
  for a new user (a GitHub account is required); then they approve the code, which must match the
  one you gave. Continue with steps 2–3, then:

  ```bash
  spice-launch.sh login ./acme-agent-data --wait
  ```

  It returns once they approve and lists their orgs; choose the org with the user. The code expires
  5 minutes after `login`; running `login` again starts a new one. The CLI stores the credential in
  the macOS keychain, or elsewhere in `DIR/.env` (kept out of git).

Never ask the user to paste a password, token, or key into the conversation. Unattended runs (CI,
scheduled `verify` or `status`) need a credential that is not a person's: an OAuth client
(organization **Settings → OAuth Clients**) with apps, deployments, secrets, monitors, and
reactions read/write scopes, set as `SPICE_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID` and `SPICE_CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET` in the
environment or `.env.local`. The helper uses, in order: `SPICE_API_TOKEN` (a personal access token),
an OAuth client, then the login.

### 2. Turn the scenario into a brief

Pull these from what the user said, and ask only for what you cannot default:

| Item | Default when unstated |
| --- | --- |
| Sources: type, location, tables or prefixes, rough size, freshness | None — ask for connection details. Never invent hosts, accounts, or table names |
| Where each credential lives | Ask: their environment/`.env.local`, or an org secret (`preflight` lists which references match one) |
| Consumers: agents over MCP, apps over SQL/HTTP, chat over the OpenAI API | Agents over MCP plus SQL |
| Models: provider and role (agent with tools, text-to-SQL, embeddings for search) | One OpenAI chat model with `tools: auto`, keyed by `${ secrets:SCP_OPENAI_API_KEY }` (below) unless the user brings their own key |
| Profile: `demo`, `poc`, or `production` | "Demo tomorrow" → demo; evaluation or customer trial → poc; "production", "greenfield", "operate", "on-call" → production |
| Org, project name, region | Org from `login` (one the user owns or administers); a 4–38 character name such as `acme-agent-data`; the region nearest the data (`us-east-1` or `us-west-2`) |
| Alert recipients | The user's email |

A new Spice.ai Cloud account comes with $25 of OpenAI credit as the org secret
`SCP_OPENAI_API_KEY`, which Spice manages: it is never listed among the org's secrets, and `secrets`
links it to the project like any org secret. Use it for OpenAI chat and embedding models in demos
and POCs when the user has no OpenAI key of their own; for production, or when the credit runs out,
reference the user's own key. Organizations created before the credit existed don't have it
(`secrets` reports it `missing`).

When a named source has no credentials yet, say so and pick with the user:

- **demo**: a clearly labeled stand-in from public data playing the same role (see
  `references/scenarios.md`), swapped for the real source later.
- **poc / production**: deploy the rest and list the source as pending, or wait. Never mark it done.

Sources must be reachable from Spice Cloud. A database on `localhost`, a private subnet, or behind
a VPN cannot be read by a managed project, and neither can `file:` paths on the user's machine.
`deploy` refuses both before it starts.

### 3. Design the spicepod

Read `references/scenarios.md` for each source and model, then write `DIR/spicepod.yaml`. Start
from `examples/spicepod.agents.yaml` (Snowflake, Postgres, S3, and OpenAI for agents). The choices
that matter most:

- **Name and describe every dataset.** Agents discover data through `list_datasets` and
  `table_schema`, so `description:` is their only map.
- **Accelerate what is small and hot; federate what is large.** The default Cloud instance has a
  4 GiB memory limit. Arrow acceleration holds a table in memory at several times its Parquet size,
  and a table too large for it drove a test instance to 90% memory and an unhealthy state while
  loading. Accelerate tables you know are small, narrow big ones with `refresh_sql`, or leave them
  federated. When the size is unknown, deploy federated first and measure with `SELECT COUNT(*)`.
  More memory is only an option when `preflight` reports `private_compute: true`.
- **Write search `row_id`s as lists** (`row_id: [id]`): Spice Cloud rejects a single value when the
  deployment starts, although `spice validate` accepts it.
- **Secrets only as `${ secrets:NAME }`.** Never put a value in the spicepod.
- **Give models tools.** Without `tools`, chat answers can't query data; `tools: auto` grants `sql`,
  `table_schema`, `list_datasets`, `search`, and more. MCP clients get the tools regardless.
- **Add the Cloud runtime block.** Without `runtime.mcp.allowed_hosts: ["*"]`, `/v1/mcp` answers
  `403 Host header is not allowed` on Spice Cloud, and listing the public hostname does not help.
  The project API key still guards the endpoint. Add `runtime.query.timeout` so one runaway agent
  query can't hold the instance:

  ```yaml
  runtime:
    mcp:
      allowed_hosts: ["*"]
    query:
      timeout: 30s # (v2.2.0+)
  ```

- **Prefer views for cross-source questions** (`views:` with a SQL join of a Postgres and an S3
  dataset): agents then query one well-described table instead of rediscovering the join.
- **Size connection pools for shared databases.** Each Postgres or MySQL dataset keeps its own pool
  (Postgres `connection_pool_size` 5 with `pg_connection_pool_min_idle` 1; MySQL `mysql_pool_max` 5
  with `mysql_pool_min` 1), so eight datasets on one server can hold 40 sessions. Lower them for a
  server behind PgBouncer or with a small `max_connections`.

### 4. Preflight, and optionally run locally

```bash
spice-launch.sh preflight ./acme-agent-data --project acme/acme-agent-data
```

Stop on `blockers`; `management_token_missing` means step 1 has not finished. `secret_references`
says where each `${ secrets:NAME }` can come from: `available_locally`, `org_secret`, or (for an
existing project) `project_secret`. A warning names any that has none: get the value from the user,
or have them create the org secret.

Run `local` whenever the sources are reachable from this machine. It loads every component, queries
every dataset and view, and stops the runtime, catching configuration, type, and source problems in
seconds, while each Cloud deploy cycle takes minutes. Components whose secrets exist only in Cloud
come back `needs_cloud_secret` (status `checked`); `deploy` and `verify` check them.

### 5. Create the project and connect its secrets

```bash
spice-launch.sh create ./acme-agent-data --project acme/acme-agent-data --region us-east-1 --profile poc
spice-launch.sh secrets ./acme-agent-data
```

`secrets` resolves each reference in this order:

- **A project secret** of that name is kept.
- **An org secret** (organization **Settings → Secrets**) reaches a project only through a link;
  `secrets` creates it through the Management API, including for the platform-managed
  `SCP_OPENAI_API_KEY`, which is never listed. It wins over a local value of the same name, so a
  personal key never shadows the organization's; `--set NAME` stores the local value instead.
- **A local value** (environment, `.env.local`, `.env`) is stored as a project secret. Values never
  appear in output or on a command line.
- **Nothing**: `missing`, and `secrets` fails before a deploy is wasted on it.

`create --base ORG/BASE` forks a project whose credentials are *project* secrets, which the API
cannot read back: the fork copies them and its links, then resets the channel to `stable` (forks
inherit the base's channel).

### 6. Deploy

```bash
spice-launch.sh deploy ./acme-agent-data
```

On failure, read `error`, `unresolved`, `datasets`, `problems`, and `hints`, fix the cause, and run
`deploy` again (a new deployment supersedes the stuck one). Typical causes are in the
troubleshooting table. The `lint` notes flag configurations worth fixing: `pg_sslmode` or
`mysql_sslmode` weaker than a verified TLS connection in production, S3 without `s3_auth`,
accelerations that never refresh, and models without tools.

A stuck deployment's new instance keeps running, and holding its connections to the sources, until
the next deploy. If you stop there, `pause` the project: on a shared or connection-limited source,
a stuck instance can lock other clients out. If Spice Cloud never marks a deployment succeeded
although its instance is ready (seen right after a pause), `deploy` confirms the endpoint serves the
new spicepod, reports `deployment_record`, and carries on.

### 7. Verify end to end

Prove what the scenario promised, not just that tables exist. Pass a cross-source query, an agent
question, and a search if the scenario has one:

```bash
spice-launch.sh verify ./acme-agent-data \
  --sql "SELECT c.segment, COUNT(*) AS orders FROM pg_orders o JOIN s3_customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id GROUP BY c.segment" \
  --ask "Which customer segment placed the most orders?" --expect "SMB"
```

Work out `--expect` from a `--sql` result first: without it, `--ask` only proves the model answered.
The first `--sql` is also the latency probe, so make it a representative agent query, and include
the scenario's heaviest legitimate query among the `--sql`s: `monitors` sets the latency alert above
it.

A failed check names its HTTP status and error. Fix it, deploy, and verify again. A `WARN` check
doesn't block, but it describes something clients must work around: put it in the report and in
the Scenario notes. The latency baseline is client-observed (it includes the network round trip
from this machine) over uncached queries; `monitors` derives its latency threshold from it.

### 8. Monitor and alert

```bash
spice-launch.sh monitors ./acme-agent-data --profile production --email oncall@acme.com --slack C0123ABCD
spice-launch.sh fire-drill ./acme-agent-data   # only after approval for firing and recovery notifications
```

`references/monitoring.md` lists each alert's meaning, units, thresholds, and first response.
Notes:

- Agents write SQL that sometimes fails and then retry, so query failures alert on a sustained rate
  (default 0.05/s for 5 minutes). For an app or dashboard where every failure matters, pass
  `--query-failure-rate 0`.
- Targets: email, a Slack channel ID (Slack must be connected to the org, else `422`), and an HTTPS
  webhook (`--webhook-token-env VAR` for its bearer token). Without targets, alerts email the
  credential's user, or the org owner for a machine credential.
- Templates are released for managed projects. `template_unavailable` means check project kind,
  configured models/acceleration, and effective CPU limit. Report the gap; repeated POSTs do not
  repair prerequisites. `monitoring_incomplete` is not production completion.
- Re-running `monitors` updates the `launch:` monitors' conditions and targets in place (keeping
  edited descriptions) and never touches others. Disabled monitors remain disabled and block
  completion; use `--enable-disabled` only after approval. Profile changes report old alerts as
  `outside_profile`; removal is a separate, approved action.
- Enabled is not healthy: inspect current metrics, readiness, dataset state, and missing-signal
  warnings. Replacement-instance false alarms were addressed upstream; treat a current missing
  signal as a coverage problem, not automatically as a harmless redeploy artifact.
- For a saved webhook, `fire-drill --webhook-token-env VAR` supplies its write-only token for the
  temporary alert. Use `--webhook-no-token` only for an unauthenticated destination. The portal's
  **Send test notification** uses saved credentials but tests delivery, not metric evaluation.
- Confirming delivery is the user's job: ask whether the alert arrived. Never search their mailbox,
  chat, or other accounts for it, even when a connected tool could.

### 9. Hand off

```bash
spice-launch.sh handoff ./acme-agent-data
```

Then fill in the **Scenario notes** section of `RUNBOOK.md`: stand-in or pending sources, agent
questions that work, data caveats, and anything the user still owns, such as linking a secret or
renewing a certificate. Write outside the `spice-launch` markers: a later `handoff` regenerates only
the text between them. Finish with this report, filled from the JSON:

```text
Launched acme/acme-agent-data (production) — https://spice.ai/acme/acme-agent-data
Endpoint https://us-east-1-prod-aws-data.spiceai.io — MCP at /v1/mcp, OpenAI-compatible at /v1
- Deployment 42370 succeeded in 18 s on 2.3.2-enterprise-models (stable); all 3 secrets resolved
- Verified 9/9: orders (Postgres, federated), customers (S3, 150,000 rows), assistant answered
  "how many customers" with 150000 via SQL, MCP sql tool returned rows
- Latency p50 283 ms, p99 303 ms (50 uncached queries, client-observed)
- Alerts: 9 active → oncall@acme.com and Slack C0123ABCD; fire drill delivered in 171 s
- Pending: Snowflake (no credentials yet); stand-in: none
- Client note: OpenAI SDK clients need Accept-Encoding: identity (set in AGENT-CONNECT.md)
- Files: spicepod.yaml, RUNBOOK.md, AGENT-CONNECT.md
- API key: spice cloud api-keys --project acme/acme-agent-data (keys contain `|`: quote them)
- Tear down: spice-launch.sh teardown ./acme-agent-data --yes
```

For a change later: edit `spicepod.yaml`, then `deploy` and `verify`; monitors persist across
deploys. For demos and POCs, offer `teardown` when the user is done, and run it only on their
confirmation.

## Profiles

| | demo | poc | production |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Replicas | 1 | 1 | 1 when agents use MCP (sessions break across replicas); 2+ only for SQL/HTTP-only consumers, within `limits.replicas` |
| Stand-in data | Allowed, labeled | Only with agreement | No |
| Alerts | Query failures, 5xx, memory, model failures (warn) | + latency, refresh errors | + CPU, Flight, dataset and instance health; failures and memory are critical |
| Fire drill | Optional | Recommended | Required before calling it done (with the user's consent) |
| TLS to sources | `pg_sslmode: require` acceptable on a demo DB; plaintext only for public data | `verify-full` / `mysql_sslmode: required` preferred | `verify-full` / `required` |
| Teardown | Offer when done | Offer at the end of the evaluation | Never without an explicit request |

`references/production.md` has the production checklist: replicas, timeouts, key rotation,
rollbacks, channel and version pinning, and capacity.

## Don't

- **Report success from `deploy succeeded`, `/v1/ready`, or `spice validate` alone.** A stuck rollout
  keeps the old version answering; only `deploy` and `verify` compare against the new spicepod.
- **Put secret values in the spicepod, in output, or on a command line.** `spice cloud secrets set
  NAME VALUE` leaves the value in shell history; `secrets` reads it from the environment instead.
  Never copy Spice Cloud tokens or API keys into project secrets, and never ask the user to paste a
  password, token, or key into the conversation: `login` uses a device code.
- **Point a Cloud dataset at `localhost`, a private IP, or `file:`.** Upload files to object
  storage; give databases a reachable endpoint with a read-only user.
- **Accelerate a table of unknown size in memory** on the default instance.
- **Run `fire-drill` without telling the user it sends a real alert,** or `teardown` without their
  confirmation. Never delete a project this helper did not create.
- **Read the user's mailbox, chat, or other accounts** to confirm an alert, or for anything else this
  workflow needs. Ask them.
- **Leave out `runtime.mcp.allowed_hosts: ["*"]`** when agents connect over MCP, or run more than
  one replica for MCP clients: requests in one MCP session then reach different instances and fail
  with `404 Session not found` (41% of calls in testing). Scale `--cpu` and `--memory` instead.
- **Install or upgrade Spice, or invent connection details.** Both are the user's to provide.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deploy` stops with `unresolved` secrets, `not found in [env]` | The secret is neither a project secret nor an org secret linked to the project | `secrets` (links the org secret of that name, or stores the value from the environment); deploy again |
| Postgres `error performing TLS handshake` | `pg_sslmode` defaults to `verify-full`, and the server certificate is self-signed, expired, or for another host, or the server offers no TLS at all | Check with `openssl s_client -starttls postgres -connect HOST:5432`; fix the cert or set `pg_sslrootcert`; `require` only for a demo DB. No TLS (`psql "host=HOST sslmode=require"` says `server does not support SSL`): `disable`, for public data only |
| Postgres `Authentication failed` | Wrong user or password, or an empty secret | Fix the secret; deploy again |
| Postgres `PostgreSQL connection failed. db error` (no detail); `psql` shows `query_wait_timeout` or `too many connections` | The server or its PgBouncer is out of connections; each dataset holds its own pool, and a stuck deployment's instance keeps its pools open | Lower `connection_pool_size` and `pg_connection_pool_min_idle`; `pause` a stuck project |
| MySQL `Client asked for SSL but server does not have this capability` | `mysql_sslmode` defaults to `required`, and `preferred` does not fall back to plaintext | Enable TLS on the server, or `mysql_sslmode: disabled` for public data only |
| A MySQL dataset stays `Initializing` with no error (`deploy` stops after `--init-timeout`), or fails with `Disk full (/tmp/#sql...)` | On MySQL 5.x or MariaDB 10.0, the runtime's `information_schema` metadata read scans every database the user can see; a server with thousands takes many minutes | Connect as a user granted only the databases the spicepod reads, or use MySQL 8.0+ |
| Every view fails with `table ... not found` while datasets work | Views register only after every dataset loads, so one dataset in Error holds them all back | Fix that dataset; `local` reports `views_not_registered` |
| `deploy` reports `deployment_record` `in_progress` | Spice Cloud did not mark the deployment succeeded though its instance is ready (seen right after a pause) | None needed: `deploy` confirmed the endpoint serves the new spicepod; the next deploy supersedes the record |
| `Failed to load LLM ... Incorrect API key` or `You didn't provide an API key` | Bad or missing model key | Fix the secret. Until then the runtime never becomes ready |
| `Failed to load LLM ... insufficient_quota` or `exceeded your current quota` | The key has no quota left; with `SCP_OPENAI_API_KEY`, the $25 credit is used up | Reference the user's own key, then `secrets` and `deploy` |
| `secrets`: `SCP_OPENAI_API_KEY` `missing` | The organization predates the OpenAI credit | Reference the user's own key; the `SCP_` name is reserved and cannot be created |
| `Memory usage at 90% ... while loading` in `problems` | An acceleration larger than the instance | Federate it or narrow it with `refresh_sql`; raise `--memory` only with private compute |
| `deploy`: `could not start the deployment`, `400 Invalid spicepod configuration` | Cloud checks the published Spicepod schema, which is stricter than `spice validate` | Write search `row_id`s as lists; compare other fields with the [Spicepod reference](https://spiceai.org/docs/reference/spicepod) |
| `Resource limits can only be updated when private compute is enabled` | The org has no private compute | Keep the default size; federate or narrow accelerations |
| CPU or memory reports missing telemetry | Signal coverage lost for a stable instance name | Check running instances and telemetry; missing data is not recovery; see `references/monitoring.md` |
| `/v1/mcp` → `403 Host header is not allowed` | `runtime.mcp.allowed_hosts` missing | Add `["*"]` and deploy |
| MCP calls fail with `404 Session not found` mid-conversation; `verify` reports `session_not_found` | More than one replica: a session lives in one instance | `spice cloud project update --replicas 1` (scale CPU/memory instead), deploy |
| An OpenAI SDK client gets `502 Bad Gateway` from `/v1/chat/completions` while curl works; `verify` shows a WARN for `Accept-Encoding: gzip` | Non-streaming chat completions fail when the client asks for a compressed response, which the OpenAI SDKs do by default | Send `Accept-Encoding: identity` (Python `default_headers`, TypeScript `defaultHeaders`; AGENT-CONNECT.md does), or stream |
| `verify`: model answers but the data question is wrong | `tools` missing or too narrow, or a vague dataset description | `tools: auto`, better `description:` fields, a view |
| `monitors`: `create_failed` with 422 | Slack is not connected to the org | Connect Slack in org settings, or use email or a webhook |
| `monitors`: `update_failed` with 403 | Updating a monitor needs org admin | Use an admin's credential with `monitors:write`; retain the same alert ID |
| `monitors`: disabled / `verification_failed` / `monitoring_incomplete` | Disabled alert, mismatched saved fields, or missing prerequisites | Inspect GET and repair the reported gap; approve re-enabling separately |
| `fire-drill` never fires | No live deployment, or evaluation lag | Confirm `status` is healthy; retry with `--timeout 600` |
| `management_token_missing` | No credential the helper can read | Step 1: `login` (sign-in or sign-up with a device code) |
| `org_not_accessible` | An OAuth client from another org | OAuth clients act only in their own org; use that org's client |
